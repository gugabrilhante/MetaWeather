run 'app' target to run MetaWeather using www.metaweather.com/api/
run 'testapp' target to run the same feature with mocked values

this project is divided in modgit ules:
core: all modules can implement it, its where is stored contracts and usable stuff
locationweatcher: is a feature module, this feature render the location information on the screen
app: this is the main app, is responsible to inject the right dataSources implementations and call features module
testapp: is a module for testing, inject mockDataSources so the information will always be from mock, usually has less libraries and build faster

improvements to do:
- first time using compose, don't know a lot about best practices
- manual injection is not very scalable, but setup dagger2 would take more time...
- gradle dependencies can be more organized, but would take more time...
- same models is been used for gson and domain logic, can be improved there
- need to research why glideImage for compose is not working
